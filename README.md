# Theater_Web_App_C#_.NET_MVC
## Introduction
Project with The Tech Academy to practice C# integrated with front end web development using ASP .Net MVC and Entity Framework. This is the second live project with The Tech Academy that simulates an agile sprint. On the first Monday of the sprint we were introduced to the students we will be working with. The weekend prior we were able to clone the project skeleton and browse project guidlines in Azure DevOps to prepare. The task at hand is to design software for a theater company that manages their website content. This emulates building a content managment system for the heater to easily manage what displays on their website. To organize and delegate tasks, the site was broke down into 3 areas, and I was tasked with working on the Rental Area. The rental area handles all rental requests, rental equipment and rooms, and post-rental surveys. I specifically worked on the Rental Requests. This project exercied front and back end development skills as well as clean version control practices with Git. The IDE all students used was Visual Studio.
